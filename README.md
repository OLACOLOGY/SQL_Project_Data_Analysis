# Background
To succeed in the data analyst job market, I started a project to find out how to secure high-paying, in-demand jobs. I carefully analyzed the data I gathered from my SQL course. This data provided important insights about job titles, salaries, locations, and the key skills that help candidates stand out.

The data I acquired from [SQL Course](https://www.lukebarousse.com/sql) offers valuable insights into job titles, salaries, locations, and essential skills, guiding me towards my goal.

### My SQL queries aimed to answer some captivating questions:
1. What are the top-paying data analyst jobs?
2. What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?
3. What skills are most in demand for data analysts?
4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries?
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn?

# Tools I used
For my deep dive into the data analyst job market, I utilized a suite of essential tools:

- **SQL :**  Served as the core of my analysis, enabling me to extract and analyze key insights from the data.

- **PostgreSQL :** My preferred database management system, well-suited for organizing and managing job posting data.

- **Visual Studio Code :** Used for writing and running SQL queries, as well as managing database tasks efficiently.

- **Git & GitHub :** Employed for version control and sharing my SQL scripts and findings, promoting collaboration and maintaining a clear project history.

# The Analysis
Each query for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the data analyst job market. Here‚Äôs how I approached each question:

### 1. Top Paying Data Analyst Jobs
To identify the highest-paying roles, I filtered data analyst positions by average yearly salary and location, focusing on remote jobs. This query highlights the high paying opportunities in the field.

``` sql
SELECT 
    job_id,
    job_title,
    job_posted_date,
    salary_year_avg,
    name AS company_name
FROM job_postings_fact 
LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE
    job_location = 'Anywhere' AND 
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY 
    salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10
```
### Here's the breakdown of the analysis:
#### üè¢ Top Paying Companies
 - Mantys leads with the highest pay overall.
 - Big tech and healthcare companies like Meta, Pinterest, AT&T, and UCLA Healthcare Careers are also prominent, offering salaries ranging from $217k to $336k+.

### üìà Salary Distribution Insight
 - The salary range of the top 10 jobs spans from $184,000 to $650,000.

 - There's a large jump between the top-paying role and the rest, showing that outliers (like Mantys) significantly raise the ceiling.

### üîç Key Observations
 - Titles with ‚ÄúDirector‚Äù, ‚ÄúPrincipal‚Äù, or ‚ÄúSenior‚Äù command the highest salaries.

 - Data Analysts with specialization (marketing, remote/hybrid) still earn impressive salaries.

 - Top roles require leadership, strategy, and often technical expertise‚Äînot just analysis.
